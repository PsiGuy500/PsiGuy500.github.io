           <p> <b>About me:</b> </p>   
           <p>Hello everyone, this is my personal website. My name is Cyrus Young and I am a fourth year Engineering Physics 
               student at UBC. Engineering Physics at UBC is a five year degree consisting of an engineering degree with 
               a focus on electrical, mechanical and software built on a foundation of applied physics and math.</p> 
   
           <p>
               I am passionate about physics (some of my favorite courses include Electromagnetic Theory, Thermodynamics and 
               Quantum Mechanics) as well as some fields within Electrical Engineering such as Digital Signal Processing, 
               Control Systems and Photonic Circuits (which is a major focus of my current research). 
           </p>    
           <p>
               My hobbies include running, playing sports with friends, and 
               reading books on a variety of topics (I am currently reading <i>The War That Ended Peace: The Road To 1914</i> 
               by Margaret MacMillan).
