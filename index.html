        <h1>Welcome to my Website</h1>
        <p>Hello everyone, this is my personal website. My name is Cyrus Young and I am a fourth year Engineering Physics 
            student at UBC. Engineering Physics at UBC is a five year degree consisting of an engineering degree with 
            a focus on electrical, mechanical and software built on a foundation of applied physics and math.</p> 

        <p>I am passionate about physics (some of my favorite courses include Electromagnetic Theory, Thermodynamics and 
            Quantum Mechanics) as well as some fields within Electrical Engineering such as Digital Signal Processing, 
            Control Systems and Photonic Circuits (which is a major focus of my current research). My hobbies include 
            running, playing sports with friends (primarily soccer and spikeball), and reading (one book series that I highly 
            recommend is the <i>Theoretical Minimum</i> series by Leonard Susskind).
        </p>
