            <p>In the summer of 2024, I was performing research in the field of \(\mu \)SR (muon Spin Resonance) 
                in the CMMS (Center for Molecular and Material Science) at TRIUMF. Before I delve directly into
                what \(\mu \)SR is, it is important to introduce what muons are and how we generate them.
            </p>
            <p> Muons are elementary particles similar to that of electrons (same spin and charge) but 
                with a mass roughly 207 times as large. To generate muons in a lab, we need to first
                generate pions, a type of meson that are composed of a quark and an antiquark. We do this by 
                firing a proton beam at a target usually made of graphite or beryllium. 
            </p>
            <p>\(p+p \rightarrow p+n+\pi^+\)</p>
            <p>\(p+n \rightarrow n+n+\pi^+\)</p>
            <p>Because pions are an unstable particle, a charged pion has a mean lifetime of about 
               \(\tau = 26\text{ ns}\) and will decay into an antimuon (a positively charged muon) and a neutrino:
            </p>
            <p>\(\pi^+ \rightarrow \mu^+ + \nu_\mu\)</p>
            <p>Here is the interesting part. So far, only left-handed neutrinos (neutrinos with a spin 
                antiparallel to their linear momentum) exist. We also know that pions have no spin. 
                Therefore, due to conservation of momentum, both the muon and neutrino are produced 
                with a spin antiparallel with their linear momentum in the pion rest frame. A diagram 
                of such a process is shown below:

            <p>Once we have our muons, we can use them to perform mu-SR. The essence of mu-SR is that we 
                take a sample and bombard it with muons. The muons will then stop in the sample and 
                precess about the local magnetic field. The precession frequency is given by:
                \(\omega = \gamma B\)</p>

            <p>I am currently working on two projects. The first project involves simulating and then building and 
                testing a frequency noise discriminator utilizing a Mach-Zender interferometer. The essence 
                of our circuit is that a laser (with noise) is inputted into the circuit. The laser is then 
                split into two beams. One of the beams goes through a phase shifter. The beams then rejoin 
                and are at quadrature (i.e. 50% amplitude). The output of the combined beam is then measured 
                on a photodiode.</p>
            <p>The second project involves creating a program in MATLAB that calculates the lineshape of a 
                laser given its Frequency Noise PSD (Power Spectral Density). The Frequency Noise PSD 
                describes the power spectrum of the noise within a laser as a function of frequency. The 
                lineshape of a laser, which shows the intensity of the output laser as a function of frequency, 
                is a good metric for measuring the quality of the laser.</p>
