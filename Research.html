            <p>I am currently working on two projects. The first project involves simulating and then building and 
                testing a frequency noise discriminator circuit utilizing an MZI (Mach-Zender interferometer). An MZI 
                frequency noise discriminator circuit is used to detect and quantify frequency noise in 
                optical communication and sensing systems. It works by splitting a coherent light source 
                into two paths, allowing them to travel different lengths or undergo different
                phase modulations, and then recombining them to create an interference 
                pattern. Frequency noise in the light source causes variations in the phase difference 
                between the two paths, which results in changes in the interference pattern's intensity. 
                Photodetectors measure these intensity variations, and signal processing techniques are 
                used to analyze and quantify the noise. This method is crucial for improving the performance 
                and precision of optical systems by mitigating the effects of frequency noise. The circuit schematic
                for the frequency noise discriminator circuit in Simulink is shown below (the numbers 1 and 2 in red are
                used to show the input and output measurements, respectively):</p>

            <p>The second project involves creating several programs in MATLAB dealing with the relationship 
                between the Frequency Noise PSD of a laser and its lineshape. The Frequency Noise PSD 
                describes the power spectrum of the noise within a laser as a function of frequency, while the 
                lineshape of a laser, which shows the intensity of the output laser as a function of frequency, 
                is a good metric for measuring the quality of the laser. It is known that there is an algorithm
                which, given the Frequency Noise PSD of a laser, can calculate the lineshape of the laser.

            <p>In the summer of 2024, I was performing research in the field of \(\mu \)SR (muon Spin Resonance) 
                in the CMMS (Center for Molecular and Material Science) at TRIUMF. Before I delve directly into
                what \(\mu \)SR is, it is important to introduce what muons are and how we generate them.
            </p>
            <p> Muons are elementary particles similar to that of electrons (same spin and charge) but 
                with a mass roughly 207 times as large. To generate muons in a lab, we need to first
                generate pions, a type of meson that are composed of a quark and an antiquark. We do this by 
                firing a proton beam at a target usually made of graphite or beryllium. 
            </p>
            <p>\(p+p \rightarrow p+n+\pi^+\)</p>
            <p>\(p+n \rightarrow n+n+\pi^+\)</p>
            <p>Because pions are an unstable particle, a charged pion has a mean lifetime of about 
               \(\tau = 26\text{ ns}\) and will decay into an antimuon (a positively charged muon) and a neutrino:
            </p>
            <p>\(\pi^+ \rightarrow \mu^+ + \nu_\mu\)</p>
            <p>Here is the interesting part. So far, only left-handed neutrinos (neutrinos with a spin 
                antiparallel to their linear momentum) exist. We also know that pions have no spin. 
                Therefore, due to conservation of momentum, both the muon and neutrino are produced 
                with a spin antiparallel with their linear momentum in the pion rest frame. A diagram 
                of such a process is shown below:
            </p>

            <p>Once we have our muons, we can use them to perform mu-SR. The essence of mu-SR is that we 
                take a sample and bombard it with muons. The muons will then stop in the sample and 
                precess about the local magnetic field. The precession frequency is given by:
                \(\omega = \gamma B\)</p>
