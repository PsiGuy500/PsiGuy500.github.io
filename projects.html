            <p><b>PCB Project</b><p>
            <p>Using KiCad, I designed a signal-generator chip that utilizes a 15V DC signal that passes through a 
                voltage regulator to produce 5V DC. This 5V is then converted to -5V to power the rails of an 
                op-amp, enabling control of the output signal amplitude. The 5V also powers a 100 kHz timer/oscillator, 
                producing a square wave signal that can be tuned in combination with potentiometers and the op-amp. 
                The tuned signal can be read from a through-hole test port.</p>
             <p>If we want to design such a PCB, we need to first create a schematic file of the form 
                “schematicname.kicad_sch” where we design and properly label the schematics for the circuit. 
                Sometimes it is necessary to manually create your own components if the component is not 
                available in the library.</p>

              <img src="Images/KiCadSchematic2.png" alt="PCB Project" width="650" height="350">  

            <p>We now have finished designing our schematic. But how do we go from a schematic to the actual 
                physical layout of the circuit? The answer is using footprints. In KiCad, the physical layout 
                of a component as it will be placed on the printed circuit board (PCB) is called its footprint. 
                 This means that we have to apply the appropriate footprint for each component. For example, 
                 the footprint for a 10 nF capacitor is shown below:</p>

               <img src="Images/PCBFootprint.png" alt="PCB Project" width="450" height="300">  

            <p>Using our completed schematic with the relevant footprints, we can now create a PCB file of the 
                form “pcbname.kicad_sch” and import our schematic. An example of the skeleton setup of our circuit 
                is shown below:</p>

               <img src="Images/SkeletonPCB.png" alt="PCB Project" width="520" height="400">
             
            <p>The next step is to actually connect the components. Remember in the beginning where I showed two 
                separate schematics? This means that we have to make two separate connection layers, both 
                utilizing copper for the connections. Once we have properly connected all our components, we can 
                generate the relevant gerber files. The gerber files will be used to eventually manufacture our 
                circuit. A picture of both the final PCB design as well as the circuit itself are shown below:

            <p><b>Fizz Detective</b><p>
            <p>This project focuses on developing a robot in a simulated environment for a project course called ENPH 353. 
                The purpose of the competition is to design a virtual robot that drives around a track (which consists 
                of, among other things, winding roads, a hill with sharp turns, and a rapidly moving model of Baby Yoda) 
                while simultaneously reading signs, character by character, 
                and storing the word of each sign to eventually display them in the form of a short story. In order 
                to navigate the course, we applied a filter to the camera of the robot and then utilized a PID controller
                based on the output of the filter. In order to read the signs, we used a convolutional neural network.

            <p><b>Mario Kart Robot</b><p>
            <p> 
                For this project, three other students and I developed a robot for a competition based on the video game
                <i>Mario Kart</i>. The competition was as follows; For a set period of time,
                two robots would race around a track and have the option to pick up blocks. Three points would be awarded
                for each lap completed and one point for each block that was picked up and the robot with the most points at the end
                would be the winner of the round. There were also magnetic "bombs" around the track. A diagram of the track 
                as well as the path our robot took is shown below:
            </p>
            <p>

            <p>
                Our robot included may features such as a tape tracker, a beacon detector, an H-bridge, an 
                opto-isolated servo, a power system as well as regulators, and IMU, and a hall effect sensor. 
            </p>
            <p>
                1) The tape tracker utilized infrared reflectance sensors to detect the tape on the track by 
                measuring the amount of light reflected back to the sensor (the track was white and the tape
                was black). This light signal was then converted to a voltage signal. The voltage signal 
                was then fed into a PID controller which would then
                be used to steer the robot. 
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
                2) The beacon detector utilized a phototransistor to detect the IR signal from the beacon. 
                The beacon emitted an IR signal that was modulated at 1 kHz. The phototransistor would then detect
                the intensity of the IR signal and convert it to a voltage signal. Along with the relative orientation
                of the beacon detector, the closer the beacon detector was to the beacon, the higher the 
                voltage signal. Once the voltage signal was high enough, the robot would then turn towards 
                the beacon and go straight torwards it until the voltage signal reached a limit. 
                By that point, the robot switche to the tape tracker to follow the track.

                3) The H-bridge, which was controlled by a PWM signal, was used to control the speed of the motor as 
                well as the polarity (polarity changes allow changes in the motors rotation direction). The H-bridge was 
                especially useful for making sharp turns as sudden changes in the motor's rotation direction and speed 
                were necessary.

            </p>    
            <p>
                4) The opto-isolated servo was used to control the steering of the robot. The servo was controlled by a PWM signal
                which would then be used to control the angle of the servo. The servo was opto-isolated to prevent any
                electrical noise from the motor from affecting the servo.
            </p>
            <p>
                5) The power system consisted of several 15V batteries that were used to power the robot. The regulators were
                used to convert the 15V signals to signals of lower voltage (such as 5V and 3.3V) that were used to power the 
                various components of the robot.
            </p>

                6) The IMU was used to detect the
