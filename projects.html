            <p><b>PCB Project</b><p>
            <p>Using KiCad, I designed a signal-generator chip that utilizes a 15V DC signal that passes through a 
                voltage regulator to produce 5V DC. This 5V is then converted to -5V to power the rails of an 
                op-amp, enabling control of the output signal amplitude. The 5V also powers a 100 kHz timer/oscillator, 
                producing a square wave signal that can be tuned in combination with potentiometers and the op-amp. 
                The tuned signal can be read from a through-hole test port.</p>
             <p>If we want to design such a PCB, we need to first create a schematic file of the form 
                “schematicname.kicad_sch” where we design and properly label the schematics for the circuit. 
                Sometimes it is necessary to manually create your own components if the component is not 
                available in the library.</p>

            <p>We now have finished designing our schematic. But how do we go from a schematic to the actual 
                physical layout of the circuit? The answer is using footprints. In KiCad, the physical layout 
                of a component as it will be placed on the printed circuit board (PCB) is called its footprint. 
                 This means that we have to apply the appropriate footprint for each component. For example, 
                 the footprint for a 10 nF capacitor is shown below:</p>

               <img src="Images/PCBFootprint.png" alt="PCB Project" width="450" height="300">  

            <p>Using our completed schematic with the relevant footprints, we can now create a PCB file of the 
                form “pcbname.kicad_sch” and import our schematic. An example of the skeleton setup of our circuit 
                is shown below:</p>

               <img src="Images/SkeletonPCB.png" alt="PCB Project" width="650" height="500">
             
            <p>The next step is to actually connect the components. Remember in the beginning where I showed two 
                separate schematics? This means that we have to make two separate connection layers, both 
                utilizing copper for the connections. Once we have properly connected all our components, we can 
                generate the relevant gerber files. The gerber files will be used to eventually manufacture our 
                circuit. A picture of both the final PCB design as well as the circuit itself are shown below:

            <p><b>Fizz Detective</b><p>
            <p>This project focuses on developing a robot in a simulated environment for a project course called ENPH 353. 
                The purpose of the competition is to design a virtual robot that drives around a track (which consists 
                of, among other things, winding roads, a hill with sharp turns, and a rapidly moving model of Baby Yoda) 
                while simultaneously reading signs, character by character, 
                and storing the word of each sign to eventually display them in the form of a short story. In order 
                to navigate the course, we applied a filter to the camera of the robot and then utilized a PID controller
                based on the output of the filter. In order to read the signs, we used a convolutional neural network.

            <p><b>Mario Kart Robot</b><p>
            <p>
                For this project, we were tasked with buliding a robot that for a competition based on the video game
                <i>Mario Kart</i> for a project course called ENPH 253 (or informally known as Robot Summer). The robot had to perform laps around a track while avoiding obstacles and also had the option
                of collecting coins (represented as solid cubes for the competition) for extra points. The robot would gain 
                3 points for each lap completed and 1 point for each coin collected.
